QUESTION COPYRIGHT (C) LEETCODE

Given a column title as appear in 
an Excel sheet, return its
 corresponding column number.
 For example:
     A -> 1    
 B -> 2    
 C -> 3     ...    
 Z -> 26    
 AA -> 27    
 AB -> 28      ... 
 Example 1:
 Input: "A" Output: 1 
 Example 2:
 Input: "AB" Output: 28

"""

#convert a character to its ASCII value
#subtract ASCII value of character 'A' from that value
#This gives result from 0(for A) to 25(for Z)
#You can add 1 to the result since we are
#indexing from zero

Time Complexity O(N)
space Complexity O(1)
class Solution:
     def titleToNumber(self, s: str) -> int:
         output = 0
         for x in s:
             output = output * 26 + ord(x)-ord('A') + 1
         return output
