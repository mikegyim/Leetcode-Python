QUESTION COPYRIGHT (C) LEETCODE
 
Given an array A of non-negative integers,
 return an array consisting of all the even e
lements of A, followed by all the odd elements of A.
 
You may return any answer array t
hat satisfies this condition.
 
  
 
Example 1:
 
Input: [3,1,2,4]
Output: [2,4,3,1]
The outputs [4,2,3,1], [2,4,1,3], 
and [4,2,1,3] would also be accepted.
 
  
 
Note:
 
    1 <= A.length <= 5000
    0 <= A[i] <= 5000
